# Java Programming I and II (MOOC.fi)

This repository contains exercises I completed from University of Helsinki's updated online Java Programming course (released 2020, course material available at https://java-programming.mooc.fi/ and https://github.com/rage/java-programming/tree/master/data).

**Java Files** contains .java files with the code for each exercise (for fast viewing), and **Project Folders** contains exercise folders which can be compiled (originally created in NetBeans).

I mainly completed Java Programming II (parts 8-14) because I already had sufficient knowledge of the material convered in parts 1-7. Here is an image of my progress:

Part 2: Repitition (recursion, loops, subdividing programs)\
Part 3: Lists, Arrays, Strings\
Part 4: object-oriented programming, objects in lists, files, reading data\
Part 5: repetitive code, primitive/reference variables, objects and references\
Part 6: lists, separating user interface and program logic, testing\
Part 7: design patterns, algorithms, larger exercises

**Java Programming II**

Part 8: HashMaps, equals method, grouping data\
Part 9: class inheritance, interfaces, object polymorphism\
Part 10: handling collections as streams, Comparable interface, StringBuilder, RegEx, Enum, Iterator\
Part 11: class diagrams, packages, exceptions, writing to files\
Part 12: type parameters, implementing ArrayList and HashMap classes, randomness, multidimensional data (magic square)\
Part 13: graphical user interfaces (GUIs), event handling, views (TicTacToe)\
Part 14: data visualization, multimedia in GUIs, GUI game (Asteroids), Maven and 3rd-party libraries
