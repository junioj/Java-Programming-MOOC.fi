This repository contains exercises I completed from University of Helsinki's online Java Programming course (course material: visit https://java-programming.mooc.fi/ or https://github.com/rage/java-programming).

Java Files contains .java files with the code for each exercise, while Project Folders contains exercise folders which can be compiled in NetBeans.
