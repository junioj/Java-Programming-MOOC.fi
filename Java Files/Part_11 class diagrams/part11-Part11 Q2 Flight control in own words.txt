1. How the method addFlight works
Your answer should be at least 75 words long

Your answer
1. Planes, flights and places are saved in a HashMap because it is a dynamic storage system, allowing users to add as many of each as they want, not allowing multiple instances of the same plane/flight/place, and allowing easy retrieval based on the object's properties.
2. A new airplane is created and added to the corresponding HashMap.
3. Departure and destination IDs are added to the places HashMap if not already present, a flight is created with the departure and destination and added to the corresponding HashMap.
